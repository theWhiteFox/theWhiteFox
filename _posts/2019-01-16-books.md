<p>This year in these 12 months, I am going to read six books and maybe more. Currently I am reading Problem Solving 101 A Simple Book for Smart People during my train ride to and from work. The rest I read and write out the code on my small white plastic laptop with the latest version of Ubuntu - 18.04 LTS “Bionic Beaver”. VSCode to write / view / debug and <a href="https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html">GNOME Terminator</a> my CLI.</p>
