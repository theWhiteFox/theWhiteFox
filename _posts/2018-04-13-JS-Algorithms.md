I love to cook, eat delicious food & learn new recipes. Algorithms for me are like recipes in programming. As my cooking skills have improved by learning recipes, my programming skills will improve by learning algorithms. I chose JS as the language to learn these algorithms / recipes because it's the language of the web and a language I want to master.

I also want to improve my problem solving / JS writing skills, these are some [JS algorithms](https://github.com/theWhiteFox/algorithms-in-js) that I will understand, not just do. 

# The Algorithms I have chosen to learn

- [Two Sum Algorithm ES6](http://thewhitefox.github.io/algorithms-in-js/two-sum/index.html)
	1. Check array for sum of two values 
	2. Learn Big O notation

- Fibonacci
  1. a great way to learn recursion
  
- FizzBuzz
  1. an interesting way to test my programming skills
  
- Dijkstra
  1. improve my understanding of networking with JS 
  
- Harmless Ransom Note
  1. Big O notation
  
- Palindrome
  1. String & array manipulation
  1. String and array methods
  
- Caesar's Cipher
  1. encryption 
  
- Reverse a string
